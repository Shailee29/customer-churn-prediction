Predicting bank customer churn using ML
# 🔄 Customer Churn Prediction Project

Hi! I created this project to predict which customers are likely to leave a bank (churn) using Python and machine learning.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Customer Churn Prediction.ipynb` – My full code with analysis
- `Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` – Dataset used
- `README.md` – Project overview (this file)

---

## 📊 What I Did

- Loaded and cleaned the customer churn dataset
- Visualized customer churn trends using Seaborn
- Built two machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
- Evaluated accuracy and performance

---

## 🛠 Skills & Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Machine Learning (sklearn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset Used

🔗 [Telco Customer Churn Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to clean real-world customer data
- How to visualize churn trends
- How to build and evaluate ML models

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Add Random Forest or XGBoost
- Use ROC Curve and AUC
- Try Streamlit UI for interactive prediction
